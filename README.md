## To build a chatbot using a vector database, you can follow these steps:

1. Choose a vector database such as Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate, AWS Kendra, etc.
2. Create a vector index for your chatbot.
3. Train a language model using a large text corpus of your choice. For e.g, for a news chatbot, you can feed in news data.
4. Integrate the vector database and the language model.
